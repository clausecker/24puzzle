/*
 * Finding the optimal partitioning from the h values in a match vector
 * is essentially finding a maximum weighted matching in a hypergraph.
 * This is NP hard but solvable in realistic time as our problem
 * instance is rather small.  The na√Øve algorithm which tried out all
 * possible partitionings, finding the best ones, requires us to check
 * 96.197.645.544 partitionings.  This is a bit too much, so a smarter
 * algorithm is employed instead.  This algorithm first considers all
 * partitionings of the tray into two halves of 12 tiles each and then
 * finds the best partitioning for each half.  This requires only
 * (12 ! 24) * (1 + 2 * (6 ! 12) / 2!) / 2! = 1.250.672.150 operations,
 * a much less scary number.
